### DEFINE UTILITIES ###

# Calculate task-agnostic overlap between embeddings
# This basically compares feature similarity structure across examples
# It's based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00414 and the accompanying demo
# https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/representation_similarity/Demo.ipynb
# For now I'll just copy over their utility functions
